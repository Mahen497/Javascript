```js
function sendAutoEmail(to){
    return function(subject){
        return function(body){
            console.log(`To : ${to}, Subject : ${subject}, ${body}`);
        };
    };
}

let step1 = sendAutoEmail('m@gmail.com');
let step2 = step1("New order confirmation");
step2('Hey Mahendra, Here is something for you');
```

### 🌱 What is this about?

This code is showing **Currying + Closures**.

* **Currying** = breaking a big task into small steps.
* **Closure** = each step “remembers” the information given earlier.

---

### 🔎 Flow (like a story)

1. **First step**

   ```js
   let step1 = sendAutoEmail('m@gmail.com');
   ```

   * You give the **email address** (`m@gmail.com`).
   * The system remembers this email.
   * `step1` now becomes a special function that is waiting for the **subject** of the email.

---

2. **Second step**

   ```js
   let step2 = step1("New order confirmation");
   ```

   * You give the **subject** (“New order confirmation”).
   * The system remembers this subject also.
   * `step2` is now a special function that is waiting for the **body text** of the email.

---

3. **Final step**

   ```js
   step2('Hey Mahendra, Here is something for you');
   ```

   * You finally provide the **body** of the email.
   * Now the system has all 3 parts:

     * To: `m@gmail.com`
     * Subject: `New order confirmation`
     * Body: `Hey Mahendra, Here is something for you`
   * So it prints (or in real life could send the email):

     ```
     To : m@gmail.com, Subject : New order confirmation, Hey Mahendra, Here is something for you
     ```

### 🤔 Why write code like this?

* Instead of giving all information at once, you break it into **steps**.
* This is useful when:

  * You know some information early (like recipient email),
  * But get other info later (like subject or body).
* It makes the code **flexible and reusable**.

✅ In plain English:
This program is like filling out an email **step by step**:

1. First you write **who the email is to**.
2. Later you write the **subject**.
3. Finally you write the **message body**.
   And each step **remembers** the earlier information.

### 🗣️ Sample Interview Explanation

Currying means breaking a function into smaller steps, where each step takes one input.
Closure means that each step remembers the data provided earlier.

In my example:

* First, I call the function with an email address. That gives me a function waiting for the subject.
* Next, I give the subject. That returns a function waiting for the body.
* Finally, when I give the body, it prints the complete email.

So instead of giving everything at once, I supply information step by step, and the function remembers previous values.

In real life, this approach is useful when we know some information early (like recipient), and the rest later (like subject or message).”**

### 🧠 Tip for Easy Interviewing

* **Use real-life analogy** → “It’s like writing a letter. First you put the recipient on the envelope, then later you add the subject, and finally the content. Each step remembers what you wrote earlier.”
* Keep it **short + structured**:

  1. Define the concept in one line.
  2. Walk through your example.
  3. End with a real-world use case.

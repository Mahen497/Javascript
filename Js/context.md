### **🔹 What is Context in JavaScript and React?**  

The term **context** can mean different things depending on where you're using it:  
- In **JavaScript**, context refers to **the value of `this` inside a function**.  
- In **React**, context refers to the **React Context API**, which is used for **state management and passing data** globally.

## **🔹 1. Context in JavaScript (`this` Keyword)**
In JavaScript, **context** refers to the object that owns the currently executing function. The value of `this` depends on **how a function is called**.

### **Example: `this` in an Object**
```js
const user = {
    name: "John",
    greet: function () {
        console.log("Hello, " + this.name);
    }
};

user.greet();  // Output: Hello, John
```
✅ Here, `this` refers to the `user` object because `greet()` is called as a method of `user`.

### **Example: `this` in Arrow Function (No Context Binding)**
```js
const user = {
    name: "John",
    greet: () => {
        console.log("Hello, " + this.name);
    }
};

user.greet();  // Output: Hello, undefined
```
❌ **Why?** Arrow functions do **not** have their own `this`. They inherit `this` from the surrounding scope.

## **🔹 2. React Context API (Global State Management)**
In React, **context** is used to pass data **without prop drilling**. It allows sharing values (like themes, authentication, user data) between components.

### **Example: Creating a React Context**
```jsx
import React, { createContext, useContext } from "react";

// Step 1: Create a context
const ThemeContext = createContext("light");

function ThemedComponent() {
    // Step 2: Use the context in a child component
    const theme = useContext(ThemeContext);
    return <p>Current theme: {theme}</p>;
}

function App() {
    return (
        // Step 3: Provide a value to the context
        <ThemeContext.Provider value="dark">
            <ThemedComponent />
        </ThemeContext.Provider>
    );
}

export default App;
```
✅ **Why Use Context?**  
- Eliminates **prop drilling** (passing props through multiple components).  
- Helps manage **global state** efficiently.

## **🔹 Summary Table**
| Context Type | Meaning | Example |
|-------------|---------|---------|
| **JavaScript Context (`this`)** | Refers to the object that owns the function | `user.greet()` → `this` is `user` |
| **React Context API** | Passes global data between components | `<ThemeContext.Provider value="dark">` |

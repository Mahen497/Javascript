### ðŸ”¹ Event Capturing

* Event Capturing is the **first phase of the event flow** in the browser.
* In this phase, an event **starts from the top-most ancestor** (like `document` or `body`) and **travels down the DOM tree** toward the target element that triggered the event.
* This is the **opposite of event bubbling**, where the event moves from the target **upward to the ancestors**.

---

### How it works

1. Event starts at the **root** (`document`).
2. Moves **down through parent elements**.
3. Reaches the **target element**.
4. (Then, if bubbling is allowed) it moves **upward** in the bubbling phase.

### How to use capturing in JavaScript

You can enable capturing by passing `true` as the third argument in `addEventListener`:

```js
const parent = document.getElementById("parent");
const child = document.getElementById("child");

// Capturing phase
parent.addEventListener("click", () => console.log("Parent clicked"), true);
child.addEventListener("click", () => console.log("Child clicked"), true);
```

**Result when you click the child button:**

```
Parent clicked
Child clicked
```

* The parent is triggered **first** because we are using capturing.

### Key Points

* Capturing phase happens **before bubbling**.
* Useful if you want **parents to handle events first**.
* Can be combined with `stopPropagation()` to **control flow**.

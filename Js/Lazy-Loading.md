## **🔹 1️⃣ Lazy Loading (Improve Page Performance)**
**Lazy loading** means images, videos, or other resources **load only when they are needed**, instead of loading everything at once.  

✅ **How to use it in HTML?**  
```html
<img src="image.jpg" alt="Lazy Loaded Image" loading="lazy">
```
✔ `loading="lazy"` tells the browser to **load the image only when it's about to enter the viewport**.  
✔ This **reduces initial page load time** and improves **performance**.

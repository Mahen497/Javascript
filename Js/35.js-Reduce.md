Perfect 👍 Let’s **repair your code** first, then I’ll explain exactly how `reduce()` works step by step.

---

## ✅ Fixed Code

```javascript
const array = [1, 2, 2];

const uniqueArray = array.reduce((acc, itm) => {
   if (!acc.includes(itm)) {
      acc.push(itm);
   }
   return acc;
}, []);  // <-- Initial value is REQUIRED

console.log(uniqueArray); // [1, 2]
```

---

## 🔎 Why did your original code break?

* You didn’t give an **initial value (`[]`)** to `reduce()`.
* Without an initial value, `reduce` uses the **first element** of the array as the accumulator `acc`.

  * In your case, `acc` started as `1` (a number).
  * Then `acc.includes` caused an error because numbers don’t have `.includes`.

---

## ⚙️ Execution Step-by-Step

Array: `[1, 2, 2]`
Initial accumulator: `[]`

---

### **Step 1**

* `itm = 1`
* `acc = []`
* `acc.includes(1)` → `false`
* Push → `acc = [1]`
* Return `[1]`

---

### **Step 2**

* `itm = 2`
* `acc = [1]`
* `acc.includes(2)` → `false`
* Push → `acc = [1, 2]`
* Return `[1, 2]`

---

### **Step 3**

* `itm = 2`
* `acc = [1, 2]`
* `acc.includes(2)` → `true`
* Do nothing → `acc = [1, 2]`
* Return `[1, 2]`

---

### ✅ Final Result

`uniqueArray = [1, 2]`

---

## 🧠 How `reduce` works (general rule)

```javascript
array.reduce((accumulator, currentValue, index, array) => {
   // do something
   return accumulator; // this becomes acc for the next iteration
}, initialValue);
```

* `accumulator (acc)` → carries the result through each loop.
* `currentValue (itm)` → the element currently being processed.
* `initialValue` → what you start with (here, `[]`).

👉 Think of `reduce` as:

> "Take a starting value, process each element one by one, and keep updating the result in `acc` until the end."

Great 👍 Let’s make a **visual flow diagram** of your code execution so you can *see* how `reduce` works.

---

### Code (fixed):

```javascript
const array = [1, 2, 2];

const uniqueArray = array.reduce((acc, itm) => {
   if (!acc.includes(itm)) {
      acc.push(itm);
   }
   return acc;
}, []);  

console.log(uniqueArray); // [1, 2]
```

---

### 🔎 Visual Flow

**Start:**

```
Initial acc = []
array = [1, 2, 2]
```

---

**Iteration 1 (itm = 1):**

```
acc = []
Check: acc.includes(1)? → false
Push 1 → acc = [1]
Return acc → [1]
```

---

**Iteration 2 (itm = 2):**

```
acc = [1]
Check: acc.includes(2)? → false
Push 2 → acc = [1, 2]
Return acc → [1, 2]
```

---

**Iteration 3 (itm = 2):**

```
acc = [1, 2]
Check: acc.includes(2)? → true
Do nothing
Return acc → [1, 2]
```

---

✅ **Final Result after reduce finishes:**

```
uniqueArray = [1, 2]
```

### 🧠 Memory Trick for Reduce

Think of `reduce` like a **snowball** rolling down a hill:

* You start with a small snowball (`initialValue`).
* Each time you pass a new element (`itm`), you decide:

  * **Add it** to the snowball (if not duplicate).
  * **Skip it** if already there.
* At the bottom of the hill, you have the **final snowball** → the reduced result.

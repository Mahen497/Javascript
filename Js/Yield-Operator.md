Perfect 😄
Let’s learn the **advanced real-life example** of `yield` — where we **send data *into* the generator using `.next(value)`** 🍕⚡

---

## 🍕 Scenario: Custom Pizza Order with Toppings

* Chef (generator) **asks which topping** you want
* You **send the topping** back using `.next("cheese")`
* Chef then **confirms** your choice and **continues to next step**

---

## 📝 Code

```js
function* pizzaChef() {
  const topping1 = yield "Which topping for Pizza 1?";
  console.log("Added", topping1);

  const topping2 = yield "Which topping for Pizza 2?";
  console.log("Added", topping2);

  return "All pizzas are ready 🍕🍕";
}

const chef = pizzaChef();

console.log(chef.next().value);       // Ask: Which topping for Pizza 1?
console.log(chef.next("🧀 Cheese").value);  // Add Cheese, Ask: Which topping for Pizza 2?
console.log(chef.next("🌽 Corn").value);    // Add Corn, All pizzas are ready
```

---

## ⚡ Output

```
Which topping for Pizza 1?
Added 🧀 Cheese
Which topping for Pizza 2?
Added 🌽 Corn
All pizzas are ready 🍕🍕
```

## 🧠 What’s Happening

| Step | Action                   | What’s happening in JS                  |
| ---- | ------------------------ | --------------------------------------- |
| 1    | `chef.next()`            | Starts generator, pauses at 1st `yield` |
| 2    | `chef.next("🧀 Cheese")` | Sends value back → stored in `topping1` |
| 3    | `chef.next("🌽 Corn")`   | Sends value back → stored in `topping2` |
| 4    | Done ✅                   | Returns final result                    |

## 🧠 Memory Trick

> Think: **yield = pause and ask**,
> `.next(value) = answer and continue`

🧠 Say in your head:

> **“yield asks 🧠 → next() answers 💬”**

If you want, I can now give you a **quick cheat sheet diagram** (1-page visual) showing:

* Basic `yield`
* `yield` + `.next(value)`
* Real-life analogy

* In real-time development, programmers use the 'yield' operator for asynchronous operations, lazy evaluations, task scheduling, iterating through large datasets, creating custom iterators, etc.

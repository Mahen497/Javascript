Great question 👍 Let’s break down **lexical scope** in simple terms.

---

## 🌱 Lexical Scope (Definition)

* **Lexical scope** means:
  The scope of a variable is determined by **where it is written in the code** (at "lexical" = compile/parse time), **not by where it is called from**.
* Inner functions have access to variables defined in their outer functions.

---

## ✅ Example

```js
function outer() {
  let name = "Mahendra";

  function inner() {
    console.log("Hello " + name); // inner can "see" name
  }

  inner();
}

outer();
```

### 🔎 Flow:

* `inner()` has **lexical scope** over `outer()` → so it can access `name`.
* Even though `name` is not inside `inner()`, because `inner()` is **written inside outer()**, it gets access.

---

## ❌ Counter Example (No Access Outside Scope)

```js
function outer() {
  let secret = "hidden";
}

console.log(secret); // ❌ ReferenceError
```

`secret` is defined in `outer()` → outside code cannot access it, because lexical scope restricts it.

## ⚡ Key Rule

👉 **Functions are executed using the scope in which they were defined, not where they are called.**

### Quick Test for You 🧩

What do you think this will print?

```js
let x = 10;

function foo() {
  console.log(x);
}

function bar() {
  let x = 20;
  foo();
}

bar();
```

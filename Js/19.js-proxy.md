Let’s clearly understand the **`Proxy` object in JavaScript** — one of the most powerful advanced features.

---

## ⚙️ What is a Proxy?

A **Proxy** in JavaScript is an object that **wraps another object** and lets you **intercept and customize operations** performed on it — like reading, writing, deleting, etc.

> Think of a Proxy as a **“middleman”** between the real object and your code.

---

## 📝 Basic Syntax

```javascript
const proxy = new Proxy(target, handler);
```

* `target`: the original object
* `handler`: an object with **trap functions** to intercept operations (like `get`, `set`, `deleteProperty`, etc.)

## ⚡ Common Proxy Traps

| Trap name        | Purpose                                 |
| ---------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| `get`            | Run code when a property is read        |
| `set`            | Run code when a property is written     |
| `deleteProperty` | Intercept deletion of a property        |
| `has`            | Intercept `in` operator (`prop in obj`) |
| `ownKeys`        | Intercept `Object.keys()`               |

## 📌 Why Use Proxy

* Validation
* Logging / Debugging
* Default values
* Virtual properties
* Data binding / Reactive frameworks (like Vue.js internally uses Proxies!)

---

## ✅ Summary

**Proxy = Control + Customize Object Behavior**

```javascript
new Proxy(target, handler)
```

---

If you want, I can also show you a **short practical example of using Proxy to make a “reactive object” (auto-update UI when value changes)** — very useful to understand real-life usage.

Want me to show that next?

## 📝 Example — Tracking Property Access

Imagine you have an object `user` and you want to:

* Show a message whenever someone **reads** or **changes** a property.

---

### ✅ Code

```javascript
const user = {
  name: "Mahendra",
  age: 25
};

const userProxy = new Proxy(user, {
  // Runs when we READ a property
  get(target, property) {
    console.log(`You read "${property}"`);
    return target[property];
  },

  // Runs when we WRITE to a property
  set(target, property, value) {
    console.log(`You changed "${property}" to "${value}"`);
    target[property] = value;
    return true; // must return true
  }
});

// Using the proxy
console.log(userProxy.name);   // Read
userProxy.age = 30;             // Write
console.log(userProxy.age);    // Read
```

---

### 🖨 Output

```
You read "name"
Mahendra
You changed "age" to "30"
You read "age"
30
```

## 💡 What Happened

| Action               | Triggered Trap | What Happened                       |
| -------------------- | -------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| `userProxy.name`     | `get`          | Logs message, returns value         |
| `userProxy.age = 30` | `set`          | Logs message, updates value         |
| `userProxy.age`      | `get`          | Logs message, returns updated value |

---

## 📌 Key Points

* `Proxy` lets you **intercept** object operations.
* `get()` runs whenever you **read** a property.
* `set()` runs whenever you **write** a property.
* This gives you **full control** over how object properties behave.

---

## ⚡ Real-life Uses

* Validating data
* Logging/debugging
* Returning default values for missing keys
* Creating **reactive data** (like in Vue.js)

---

If you want, I can now give you **one more simple example: using Proxy to return `"Not available"` if a property doesn’t exist** (very beginner-friendly).

Do you want me to show that?

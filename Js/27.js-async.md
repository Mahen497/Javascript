Great question 👍 This is exactly the kind of thing interviewers test: **“When do we use `new Promise` vs. when do we just use `fetch` or `async/await`?”**

Let’s break it down step by step:

---

### 🔹 Why `new Promise` is used in your code

In your example:

```javascript
const promise = new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
   reject("The promise is rejected");
});
```

* You are **manually creating a Promise**.
* Inside the executor `(resolve, reject) => {}`, you control when to call `resolve(...)` or `reject(...)`.
* This is usually done when you want to **wrap non-Promise APIs** (like `setTimeout`, file readers, database callbacks, etc.) into a Promise.
* In your snippet, you’re just rejecting immediately for demonstration.

---

### 🔹 Why we don’t use `new Promise` with `fetch`

```javascript
const response = await fetch("https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users/1");
```

* The `fetch()` function **already returns a Promise**.
* No need to wrap it inside `new Promise` because it’s already asynchronous.
* `fetch` resolves if the network call succeeds (even if status = 404), and rejects only on **network errors**.

So this:

```javascript
const promise = fetch("https://example.com/data");
```

already gives you a Promise, no extra `new Promise` needed.

---

### 🔹 When to use `new Promise`

1. **Custom asynchronous behavior** (like your `delay(ms)` example earlier):

   ```javascript
   function delay(ms) {
     return new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, ms));
   }
   ```

   Here, `setTimeout` is not a Promise → so we wrap it.

2. **Legacy APIs** (callback-based) → converting into Promise.

   ```javascript
   function readFileAsync(file) {
     return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
       fs.readFile(file, "utf8", (err, data) => {
         if (err) reject(err);
         else resolve(data);
       });
     });
   }
   ```

3. **Artificially rejecting/fulfilling** to test `try/catch`:

   ```javascript
   const promise = new Promise((_, reject) => reject("Forced reject"));
   ```

---

### 🔹 Clear Comparison

✅ With `fetch`:

```javascript
async function getData() {
  try {
    const response = await fetch("https://api.example.com/data");
    const data = await response.json();
    console.log("Fetched:", data);
  } catch (err) {
    console.error("Error:", err);
  }
}
```

❌ Unnecessary wrapping:

```javascript
async function getData() {
  const promise = new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
    fetch("https://api.example.com/data")
      .then(res => resolve(res.json()))
      .catch(err => reject(err));
  });

  const data = await promise; // same as above, but more complex
}
```

---

👉 **Interview Answer (short):**

* *“We use `new Promise` when the API or function we’re working with does not already return a Promise (e.g., setTimeout, callbacks). Since `fetch` already returns a Promise, we don’t need `new Promise` there — we can directly `await fetch()`. In your example, `new Promise` is used only to demonstrate rejection handling in `try/catch`.”*

Nice catch 🚀 — let’s carefully separate **`async/await`** from **`new Promise`**, because they solve different parts of the puzzle.

---

### 🔹 What `async/await` does

* `async/await` is **syntax sugar** on top of Promises.
* It makes asynchronous code look synchronous.
* But — it **doesn’t create Promises by itself**. It only works *with existing Promises*.

Example:

```js
async function run() {
  const data = await fetch("https://api.example.com"); 
  console.log(data);
}
```

Here, `await` works because `fetch` already returns a Promise.

---

### 🔹 Why `new Promise` is used in *your example*

In your code:

```js
const promise = new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
   reject("The promise is rejected");
});
```

👉 You are not calling `fetch`.
👉 Instead, you are **manually creating a Promise** (and rejecting it immediately).

Reason:

* This example is **teaching/demo code** to show how `try/catch` works with `async/await`.
* If you want to simulate a failure (like a network error from `fetch`), you need a Promise that rejects.
* Since `fetch` wasn’t used, they used `new Promise` as a *mock Promise* that rejects instantly.

---

### 🔹 Short Interview-Ready Answer

* `async/await` needs a Promise to work with.
* `fetch` already gives us a Promise → no need for `new Promise`.
* But in this example, they wrote `new Promise` **just to create a reject case** to test `try/catch`.
* In real code with `fetch`, you wouldn’t use `new Promise`.

---

✅ Think of it like this:

* `async/await` = **How you *consume* Promises**.
* `new Promise` = **How you *create* Promises** (only when needed).
* `fetch` = Already gives a Promise, so no need to wrap.

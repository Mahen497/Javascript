### ✅ What is it?

Promise chaining means using **`.then()` one after another**, where the **output of one Promise becomes the input of the next**.

---

### 📌 Example:

```js
let promise = new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
  resolve(2);
});

promise
  .then(num => {
    console.log("First then:", num);   // 2
    return num * 2;                    // Pass 4 to next
  })
  .then(num => {
    console.log("Second then:", num);  // 4
    return num * 3;                    // Pass 12
  })
  .then(num => {
    console.log("Third then:", num);   // 12
  })
  .catch(err => console.log("Error:", err));
```

### 🧠 Memory Trick

Think of Promises like a **domino chain** 🎲:
➡️ First `.then()` knocks the next
➡️ The next gets the result & continues
➡️ If one fails, `.catch()` handles it 🚑

---

### ✅ Why use it?

* To **avoid callback hell** 😵
* Run tasks **step by step** (sequentially).
* Handle errors **in one place** with `.catch()`.

👉 Real-life analogy:
1️⃣ Order food 🍔
2️⃣ After it arrives, eat it 🍽️
3️⃣ After eating, pay the bill 💳
Each step depends on the **previous one** = Promise Chaining.

Perfect 👏 — let’s break down **WCAG** in a way that’s **easy to understand, explain to others, and answer in interviews**.

## 💡 **What is WCAG?**

**WCAG** stands for:

> **Web Content Accessibility Guidelines**

It’s a set of guidelines **created by W3C** to make websites **accessible to everyone**, including people with disabilities (visual, auditory, motor, or cognitive).

🗣 **Simple way to explain:**

> “WCAG ensures that websites can be used by everyone, not just people without disabilities.”

## 🎯 **Why is WCAG Important?**

1. Legal compliance (ADA, Section 508, EN 301 549, etc.)
2. Improves user experience for all users
3. Helps SEO (accessible content is more readable by search engines)
4. Avoids excluding people with disabilities

## ⚙️ **WCAG Principles (POUR)**

All WCAG guidelines are based on **4 main principles — POUR**:

| Principle              | Meaning                                               | Example                                                  |
| ---------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| **P – Perceivable**    | Users must **see or hear content**                    | Add alt text to images, captions for videos              |
| **O – Operable**       | Users must be able to **navigate and interact**       | Keyboard navigation, visible focus states                |
| **U – Understandable** | Users must **comprehend the content**                 | Clear language, consistent navigation, error messages    |
| **R – Robust**         | Content must **work across devices and technologies** | Compatible with screen readers, mobile devices, browsers |

## 🧩 **WCAG Levels of Conformance**

WCAG has **3 levels** — each adds more accessibility:

| Level           | Description                           | Example                               |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| **A** (Minimum) | Basic accessibility                   | Add alt text for images               |
| **AA** (Medium) | Addresses most accessibility barriers | Color contrast, keyboard navigation   |
| **AAA** (High)  | Highest standard                      | Sign language videos, simplified text |

> **Most websites aim for AA compliance** — balances usability, cost, and effort.

## 🏗 **Examples of WCAG Compliance in Front-End**

1. **Images** → `<img src="hotel.jpg" alt="Deluxe room with sea view">`
2. **Keyboard Navigation** → All buttons and links reachable via Tab
3. **Color Contrast** → Text contrast ratio ≥ 4.5:1
4. **Forms** → `<label for="name">Name</label>`
5. **ARIA attributes** → `<button aria-label="Close menu">X</button>`

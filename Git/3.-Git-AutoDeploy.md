Perfect 👌 — let’s make your **Vite + React app auto-deploy to GitHub Pages** every time you push to `main`.
No more manual `npm run deploy` — it’ll happen automatically using **GitHub Actions**.

## 🚀 Step-by-Step: Auto-Deploy Vite + React App to GitHub Pages

### ✅ **1️⃣ Prerequisites**

Make sure you’ve already:

* Pushed your project to GitHub.
* The repo has `vite.config.js` and `package.json`.
* You’ve run a successful manual deploy at least once (optional but recommended).

---

### 🧾 **2️⃣ vite.config.js**

Check you have the correct `base` (same as repo name):

```js
import { defineConfig } from 'vite';
import react from '@vitejs/plugin-react';

export default defineConfig({
  plugins: [react()],
  base: '/React-PMD/', // 👈 Must match your repo name exactly
});
```

---

### 🏡 **3️⃣ package.json**

Confirm homepage and build commands:

```json
{
  "homepage": "https://mahen497.github.io/React-PMD",
  "scripts": {
    "dev": "vite",
    "build": "vite build",
    "preview": "vite preview"
  }
}
```

(You can remove `"deploy"` and `"predeploy"` scripts if you’re using auto-deploy.)

### ⚙️ **4️⃣ Add GitHub Action Workflow**

In your project root, create folder & file:

```
.github/workflows/deploy.yml
```

Add this content 👇

```yaml
name: Deploy Vite React App to GitHub Pages

on:
  push:
    branches: [ main ]  # Runs every time you push to main
  workflow_dispatch:     # Allows manual trigger

permissions:
  contents: read
  pages: write
  id-token: write

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout Repository
        uses: actions/checkout@v4

      - name: Setup Node
        uses: actions/setup-node@v4
        with:
          node-version: 20

      - name: Install Dependencies
        run: npm ci

      - name: Build Project
        run: npm run build

      - name: Upload Artifact
        uses: actions/upload-pages-artifact@v3
        with:
          path: dist

  deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    needs: build
    environment:
      name: github-pages
      url: ${{ steps.deployment.outputs.page_url }}
    steps:
      - name: Deploy to GitHub Pages
        id: deployment
        uses: actions/deploy-pages@v4
```

### 🧠 **5️⃣ Commit and Push**

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Add auto-deploy GitHub Action"
git push origin main
```

Then go to:
👉 **GitHub → Your Repo → Actions tab**

You’ll see a workflow running — once complete, it will:
✅ Build your app
✅ Deploy automatically to GitHub Pages

---

### 🌐 **6️⃣ Enable GitHub Pages**

Go to:
**Settings → Pages → Build and deployment → Source → GitHub Actions** ✅

---

### 💡 Bonus Tip

You can test anytime:

```
git commit -m "Trigger deploy"
git push
```

Within 1–2 minutes, your updated site goes live at
👉 [https://mahen497.github.io/React-PMD](https://mahen497.github.io/React-PMD)

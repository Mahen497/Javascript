## üíß **What is the Waterfall Model?**

> The **Waterfall Model** is the **oldest and simplest** Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC) model.
> It is a **linear and sequential** approach ‚Äî each phase flows **downward like a waterfall**, and the next phase starts **only after the previous one is completed**.

## üß± **Phases of Waterfall Model**

| **Phase**                           | **What Happens**                                    | **Example (Hotel Booking Website)**                           |
| ----------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **1. Requirement Gathering**        | Collect all requirements before development starts. | Client wants search, booking, payment, and review system.     |
| **2. System Design**                | Create architecture, database design, and UI plan.  | Plan how frontend, backend, and database will connect.        |
| **3. Implementation (Development)** | Developers write actual code based on design.       | Build website using React (frontend) + Node.js (backend).     |
| **4. Testing**                      | Test the entire product for bugs and functionality. | QA team checks booking flow, form validation, responsiveness. |
| **5. Deployment**                   | Release the final product to users or clients.      | Host the site on a live server.                               |
| **6. Maintenance**                  | Fix issues and apply updates after release.         | Handle bug reports and minor improvements.                    |

Each step flows downward ‚Äî no going back up.

## ‚öôÔ∏è **Key Characteristics**

‚úÖ Simple and easy to understand
‚úÖ Phases are well-defined and documented
‚ùå Not flexible ‚Äî hard to change requirements once development starts
‚ùå Client sees final product only at the end
‚ùå High risk if requirements are unclear

## üß† **In Interview (Short Answer)**

> ‚ÄúThe Waterfall model is a traditional SDLC model where development happens step by step ‚Äî one phase after another.
> You can‚Äôt move to the next stage until the previous one is complete.
> It‚Äôs simple but not flexible ‚Äî if a requirement changes later, it‚Äôs very hard to go back and modify.
> Agile and Iterative models were introduced later to overcome these limitations.‚Äù

## üí¨ **Example You Can Say:**

> ‚ÄúIn Waterfall, if you‚Äôre developing a hotel booking website ‚Äî first you gather all requirements, then design the system, develop it fully, test it, and only then deliver it.
> The problem is, if the client wants to change something during development, it‚Äôs difficult to adapt.‚Äù

Would you like me to also give you a **comparison chart** of **Waterfall vs Agile vs Iterative**, so you can quickly revise for interviews?

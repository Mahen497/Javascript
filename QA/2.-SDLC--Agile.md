## 🚀 **What is Agile?**

> **Agile** is a **flexible and iterative approach** to software development where the project is divided into small parts called **sprints** (usually 1–2 weeks).
> The goal is to deliver **working software quickly**, get **continuous feedback**, and **adapt to changes** easily.

In short:
👉 “Build small, deliver fast, get feedback, improve continuously.”

## 🧩 **Key Principles (from Agile Manifesto)**

1. **Customer collaboration** over contract negotiation
2. **Working software** over documentation
3. **Responding to change** over following a strict plan
4. **Individuals and interactions** over tools and processes

## ⚙️ **Agile Process (Simplified Flow)**

```
Plan → Design → Develop → Test → Review → Deploy → Feedback → Next Sprint
```

✅ Every sprint delivers a **working product increment** (not just documents).
✅ Teams meet daily (stand-ups), review progress, and plan next actions.

## 🧠 **Agile Frameworks**

Agile isn’t one process — it has **different frameworks**:

| Framework                    | Key Idea                                                                                                      |
| ---------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Scrum**                    | Work divided into fixed-time sprints (1–2 weeks) with roles like Scrum Master, Product Owner, and Developers. |
| **Kanban**                   | Continuous delivery using a visual board (To Do → Doing → Done).                                              |
| **XP (Extreme Programming)** | Focus on high-quality code and testing.                                                                       |

## 🏨 **Example (Hotel Booking Website)**

* **Sprint 1:** Design homepage + hotel search
* **Sprint 2:** Add booking and user login
* **Sprint 3:** Integrate payment gateway
* **Sprint 4:** Add reviews + bug fixes

After each sprint:

* Team shows demo to client
* Client gives feedback
* Changes are applied in next sprint

So development + feedback happen **side by side** — not at the end.

## ✅ **Advantages**

* Fast delivery of working product
* Flexible to changes
* Continuous feedback from client
* Higher customer satisfaction
* Better team collaboration

## ❌ **Disadvantages**

* Needs experienced, self-organized team
* Harder to estimate time/cost
* Continuous involvement required from client

### **ðŸ’¡ Notes & Tips**

1. Always **build small apps/projects** as you learn. Practice > Theory.
2. Use **VS Code** + **React DevTools** for debugging.
3. Donâ€™t rush â€“ take 1â€“2 extra days per week if needed.
4. Once comfortable, start **Next.js** for server-side rendering & full-stack React apps.
5. Maintain a **GitHub repo** for all your projects â€“ useful for interviews.
